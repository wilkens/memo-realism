# Measuring modernity in Scandinavian literature

Code and (limited) data for the article "Deep distant reading: The rise of realism in Scandinavian literature as a case study" by Jens Bjerring-Hansen and Matthew Wilkens, _Orbis Litterarum_ (2023).

Underlying text data from the [Measuring Modernity](https://nors.ku.dk/english/research/projects/measuring-modernity/) project at the University of Copenhagen is expected to be available for public release in 2024.

## Notebooks

The `memo.ipynb` notebook contains data processing and analysis. It is pedagogical in nature and contains additional results not presented in the article.

## Directories

### `figures`

Data visualizations. Images are generally of higher resolution than those embedded in the notebooks.

### `results`

File outputs from preparation and analysis code. Mostly statistics and similar, with some derived datasets that can be reproduced by running project code.
